# Context Engineering

Context engineering is the practice of managing and optimizing how information is presented to large language models within their limited context windows. As LLMs process conversations and documents, they can only "see" a finite amount of text at any given time - this limitation is known as the context window.

## Why Context Windows Matter

The context window is one of the most critical constraints in working with LLMs because it directly affects:

- **Memory**: What the model can "remember" from the conversation
- **Coherence**: How well the model maintains context across long interactions
- **Performance**: Processing time and computational requirements
- **Cost**: API costs are often proportional to token count
- **Quality**: Too much or too little context can impact response quality

When the context window is exceeded, models typically:
- Crash or return errors
- Truncate important information
- Lose track of conversation flow
- Provide inconsistent or irrelevant responses

## Context Window Management Strategies

Different strategies have emerged to handle context window limitations:

1. **Sliding Context Window** - Keep the most recent messages
2. **Token-based Dropping** - Remove oldest messages when token limit is reached
3. **Summarization** - Compress older messages before dropping them
4. **Hybrid Approaches** - Combine multiple strategies

Each approach has trade-offs between memory retention, performance, and implementation complexity.
